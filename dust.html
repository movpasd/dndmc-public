  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Dust forms through the progressive degradation of the solids around us. It's an
uncomfortable reminder of a microscopic world that not only exists all around
us, but interacts with the more familiar macroscopic.</p>
<p>In my scientific education, the idea that has changed my perspective on the
world around me most profoundly might have been my introductory materials
science course I took in my first year of university. It was quite cursory, of
course, but it made me realise that the world around me was this endless flux
of atoms and structure. A steel rod is not "merely" made of steel. It is steel
atoms arranged in an astoundingly complex arrangement of structure upon
structure upon microstructure.</p>
<p>It was a moment that psychologists might call an "accommodation": The expansion
of one's internal model of reality to <em>accommodate</em> new information that cannot
fit within one's existing models. I live for those moments. Moments when you
realise that you've been taking an idea for granted, an idea that in truth
merits closer inspection, and you perform that closer inspection and you become
a bigger person for it.</p>
<p>I suppose the thing I'd been taking for granted was <em>solidness</em>; <em>rigidity</em>;
what it meant for an <em>object</em> to be an object; or perhaps even <em>thingness</em>, the
fact of being a single unified entity. A cup is a cup, and I move that whole
cup around when I move it. But in fact, it isn't. Rigidity is a concept that
exists only at a particular scale of size and stiffness. Try to pick up a metal
sheet a hundred metres across, or to grab water as if it were solid, and the
concept breaks down.</p>
<p>I think this is quite a common learning obstacle in physics education. On
physics question-answer forums, I can't count the number of confusions I've
seen about reference frames, which goes something like this -- "if I'm in a
train, I'm in its reference frame; but if I leave it, at what point do I leave
the reference frame?" A question that I'm certain anyone who has studied
physics has had to ask themselves. Of course, the answer is that the reference
frame has nothing to do with the train's geometric boundaries. It's not a thing
you can be "in" or "out" of, the way you can be in or out of a room.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the "what if I have a rod a lightyear across and push one end
of it?" The expectation is that the far end of the rod should immediately begin
to move in response to the push, and it stems from a conceptualisation of the
rod as One Thing, with its associated concepts of indivisibility and rigidity.</p>
<p>These are all questions I've asked myself at some point in my education, and
found partially satisfactory answers to, but it wasn't until that moment of
accommodation during some first-year Materials Science uni lecture that it all
clicked together. It was a <em>Matrix</em> moment: "There is no spoon." Indeed, there
is no rod, there is no train, and there is no cup. There are only atoms and
void.</p>
<p>Dust. It arises from the progressive degradation of the solid matter in our
environment. (Is it an inevitable consequence of the 2nd law of thermodynamics?
Indeed, to free up material from its rigid confinement in a solid material
structure is to allow its degrees of freedom to move more independently than
when it was in it. So it has more entropy, or at least, the potential for more
entropy. A pile of sand has more entropy than a chunk of quartzite.)</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed your clothes getting a little threadbare, or the patterns
printed upon it degrading? Where did the threads of your once <em>threadplenty</em>
favourite T-shirt go? They were pulverised. Perhaps not entire threads, perhaps
only the exterior layers of the threads still holding onto self-contained
Thingness, but pulverised, turned to dust on the counter, lint in the lint
trap, dust mite breakfast! (Or is it? Do dust mites eat fabric shreds?
Unsure.)</p>
<p>The thingness of the things around us is an illusion. You don't have furniture.
There are atoms, and you think they are furniture. The exterior layers of the
wood of your shelf is incessantly sloughing off into the entropic soup we
unknowingly bathe in. With every scratch, every nick, every blemish, particles
of lignin are shredded and thrust into the air, where they will roll around and
degrade into chaotic strands of polymers, and from there through biological or
chemical processes broken into their constituent sugars and back out into the
ecological and geological cycles of the Earth.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I don't like dust. I'm allergic.</p>
<p>I should get back to dusting.</p>
