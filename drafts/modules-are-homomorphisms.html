    <p>For a while now I've been frustrated by the lack of rigorous mathematical
formalisation of software modularity. I've been circling around the idea of
graph theory and "granularisation" of graphs trying to find a good definition,
when I realised the solution had been under my nose the whole time:
<strong>homomorphisms!</strong> This post sketches out the main concepts, but at some point
I will write this all out in more detail.</p>
<p>If a set of dependencies between software elements (say, procedures and structs
for procedural programming, or classes and methods for OOP) is represented by a
directed graph (with $a \rightarrow b$ meaning "b depends on a"), then a
modularisation of of these elements is just a homomorphism $\phi$ which maps
these to a new graph, whose vertices are the modules, and the edges
dependencies between the higher-level modules.</p>
<p>(By the way, the title of this post should strictly speaking be "modules
are <em>images of</em> homomorphisms", or "<em>modularisations</em> are homomorphisms", but
that was less catchy.)</p>
<p>(My choice of having $\rightarrow$ mean "is required by" rather than the more
natural-seeming "depends on" is because it's more natural for the partial order
on a DAG to be given by $\rightarrow$ becoming $\leq$, so that the basic
language or standard library is given by a smallest rather than largest
element. I'm not 100% certain this is the right convention, though.)</p>
<p>We might want to not only consider dependency, but also <em>degree</em> of dependency.
I can think of two ways of accomplishing this. Multiple edges could represent
repeated dependencies (if class $A$ references class $B$ twice, there are two
edges $B \rightarrow A$), and then we could impose a condition on $\phi$ that
the number of edges is conserved. (Then modularisation is just vertex
contraction.) Another way is to assign weights to edges, and consider
homomorphisms which conserve sum of weights.</p>
<p>We might also want to keep track of the <em>size</em> of modules by assigning a
vertex-weight to each module, which counts the number of constituent elements.</p>
<h3>Alternate measures of coupling</h3>
<p>So far, my discussion has been exclusively on <em>dependency</em> as the appropriate
measure of <em>coupling</em>. Now, to be sure, "coupling" does not have a
mathematically well-defined meaning (unlike dependency which is easily modeled
using directed graphs). Therefore, I'm free to define it however I like so long
as it captures the intuition about what "coupling" is supposed to mean -- </p>
<p>I read once (I think it was on <a href="wiki.c2.com">WikiWikiWeb</a>), that coupling ought
to be measured by <em>probability of change</em>, not dependency. This is a decent
point. It is much more OK for two modules to be highly interdependent if
neither is going to change much. This suggests we think about a theory of
change for dependency graphs.</p>
<p>All change in a codebase may be summarised by some set of deletions and
additions. I think it's fairly uncontroversial to say that in software,
the adding code part is always easier than the removing code part. That's how
spaghetti code ends up getting written: adding and adding without ever removing.
This is reflected in the one-way nature of dependency. If $a \rightarrow b$,
then $b$ can be modified to take or not take $a$ as a dependency without
modifying $a$, but $a$ can't be modified without requiring $b$ to change.
<em>Breaking changes flow one way</em>, and that way is downstream. This causal
structure is what causes dependency hell.</p>
<p>We might also consider code which is thematically connected to be more proximal
and thus more logically grouped together into modules, though I would
<a href="{filename}/thematic-modules-harmful.md">advise against that</a>, personally. This
can be modelled by adding an extra weighted edge between code elements which
have a thematic connection. Besides thematic, there might be other types
of <em>conceptual connections</em> between elements, like semantic coupling
(where coupling arises due to the use of similar language), which reinforce
their proximity even if they are not strictly speaking dependent.</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<h3>Self-dependency</h3>
<h3>Module patterns</h3>
<h3>Modules &amp; submodules</h3>
<p>One of the reasons I like this homomorphism approach so much is that it's very
composable. The modularised elements have the exact same structure as the
elements underlying them (weighted directed graph), meaning that they can be
further supermodularised. So the homomorphism model captures</p>
