  <div class="post-content">
    <p>There are two methods of thinking when playing chess (or any abstract strategy
game) -- <em>calculational</em> or <em>tactical</em> thinking, and <em>heuristic</em> or <em>strategic</em>
thinking. In chess we might also call the latter <em>positional</em> thinking.</p>
<p>This is somewhat strange. After all, chess is a combinatorial game of perfect
information. If you lose, it is not because you rolled a dice imperfectly, nor
because you had to guess what an opponent would play and by misfortune guessed
poorly -- it is because you played a bad move. Therefore, it is strange
(at least to me) that heuristics should be involved at all.</p>
<p>Here's it put another way. When you play chess, you constantly make decisions
based on <em>probability</em>. When you decide to put a knight on a central square,
it's not because you know that 21 moves down the line you're going to be able
to threaten a fork. You put that knight there because you know that from a
central square, you're <em>more likely</em> to be able to get it involved in a tactic
down the line.</p>
<p>We are forced to make probabilistic decisions because the search space is far
too large due to the combinatorial nature of the game, despite there being
absolutely no probability whatsoever in the game itself. From the moment you
set up the pieces on the board, the game is one single extended tactical
combination, one long forced win or draw; and the only reason it is ever not
that is because at some point a player makes a mistake.</p>
<p>You might think chess engines are different, but in fact they're not! Sure,
chess engines are able to calculate much, much deeper than humans, and that is
the main reason why they absolutely dominate human players; however, they
cannot calculate all the way down to checkmate from a complicated position
(and likely will never be able to barring massive improvements in computer
technology or the development of novel algorithms for reducing the search
space).</p>
<p>Instead they look a couple of dozen moves deep (at most), and then <em>evaluate the
resulting position</em>. And that evaluation function must be supplied by
a <em>human</em>, based on centuries of <em>human</em> chess position evaluation heuristics.
I mean, sure, a lot of it is common sense ("more pieces = more win"). But
because of this, chess engines often overlook fortresses and other clearly
drawn situations, insisting they might be able to squeeze out a win due to
superior material. In this sense, chess engines also have no choice but to
rely on probabilistic reasoning.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how exactly to make rigorous, mathematical sense of this paradox.
How can a game without any probability require probabilistic reasoning? I'm
sure some mathematician specialising in game theory will have done research on
this. But I'll throw out an idea of how you might approach it.</p>
<p>The idea is to borrow a page out of statistical mechanics and the notion of
microstate vs macrostate. You would divide the space of possible chess
positions (microstates) into parts (macrostates) according to various
properties of the position (such as material, piece activity, number of passed
pawns, and such). You would then argue that within each of these classes, a
certain fraction of the positions are won for White, a certain fraction are won
for Black, and a certain fraction are drawn. Evaluation of a position then
comes down to identifying the properties of the position and arguing that
because the position has this or that set of properties, it is more or
less <em>likely</em> that White or Black is winning or that the game is drawn.</p>
<p>The issue with this is that it just pushes the problem down one step. How do you
figure out those fractions without just calculating every position? What our
human brains do is they look back on all the games that we have played as well
as all the theory we have studied, and assign approximate probabilities to
these different macrostates. You could do the same thing: look at a database of
all games, look at every position that arises in those games, classify them
according to the properties you're studying, and derive win/draw percentages
from that.</p>
<p>The issue with <em>that</em> is that it effectively introduces a notion of "metagame".
It's conceivable that human play may get stuck in a metastable equilibrium, and
so that your win/draw proportions are not actually objective but depend on the
particularities of the metagame. Consider this as an illustration: if you fed
this model games exclusively from the 19th century, versus games exclusively
from the 21st, the former is likely to put much less stock on material and much
more on piece activity; this is not because the game has actually changed
since, but because of the <em>style of play</em> that was prevalent at the time
(i.e.: the metagame).</p>
<p>This "macrostate" idea is arguably quite close to the way actual humans evaluate
chess positions. We make <em>arguments</em> as to why White or Black is winning in
this or that position, and the support those arguments we point to <em>reasons</em>.
Such reasons (such as "Black's king is exposed" or "White has a great outpost
on f6") are the macrostates.</p>
<p>One last elaboration. Instead of considering only the ultimate evaluation of the
game based on a property of the current position, you could approach this
more "dynamically" by considering the probabilities of transitioning to other
positions with different properties. For example, a material imbalance of
20 to 21 is quite likely to eventually transition to one of 3 to 4, while it's
much less likely to end up at 19 to 12.</p>
