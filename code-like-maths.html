    <p>I don't mean that programming is <em>mathematical</em> (which is of course is), or that
mathematics is <em>mechanical</em> (which it sometimes also is). I mean that the
actual process of software design and writing code is a lot like the process of
doing and creating mathematics.</p>
<p>In both cases, you are trying to define the right structures so that they do the
right thing. In software design, you are defining the parts and interactions of
a complex system, to get it to produce the functionality desired. (If that
sounds gross and OOP to you, replace "parts and interactions" with "modules and
dependencies".) In mathematics, you're defining mathematical objects so that
they do something interesting and trying to prove it. In both cases, it's
trying to find the right definitions for the job.</p>
<p>One of the key differences is that mathematicians <em>want</em> their definitions to do
something exciting and unexpected. If a piece of software does something of the
sort, we usually call that a bug.</p>
<p>But not always. There are certain software design approaches which value the
unexpected, usually by harnessing the emergence of functionality from the
juxtaposition of many small modules. Like the UNIX philosophy. Or functional
programming approaches, where power often comes from [combinatoric explosion]
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6016271/) of definable functions. If you
had a reductionist bent, you could argue that mathematics is just the
exploration of the uncomputably large space of statements that may be derived
from axioms and logical inference rules. Good definitions are those which
make that space most accessible.</p>
<p>I think there is a key takeaway from this for software design. A lot of
well-designed code is well-designed because it's designed with the pedantry and
aesthetic sensibilities of a mathematician. A well-designed piece of code
naturally covers its edge cases by the same token as a well-designed
definition.</p>
